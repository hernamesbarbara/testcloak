# TestCloak

A simple test repository demonstrating PII masking using [DocPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/docpivot) and [CloakPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/cloakpivot) together.

## Overview

This project provides a command-line tool that:
- Reads PDF documents using Docling
- Identifies personally identifiable information (PII)
- Masks sensitive data using CloakPivot
- Exports both masked and unmasked versions as markdown files

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
python pii-cloak mask --infile data/pdf/email.pdf --output-format markdown --outdir data/md/
```

## Example Output

The script processes PDF documents and produces both masked and unmasked versions. Here's an example showing the same email in both forms:

## What Gets Masked

The tool automatically detects and masks:
- üìß Email addresses ‚Üí `[EMAIL]`
- üë§ Person names ‚Üí `[NAME]`
- üìÖ Dates and times ‚Üí `[DATE]`
- üì± Phone numbers ‚Üí `[PHONE]`
- üí≥ Credit card numbers ‚Üí `[CARD-****]`
- üè† Locations ‚Üí `[LOCATION]`
- And more...

## Output Files

The script generates three files:
- `{filename}.unmasked.md` - Original content in markdown format
- `{filename}.masked.md` - Content with PII replaced by placeholders
- `{filename}.cloakmap.json` - Detailed mapping of all masked entities
