# TestCloak

A simple test repository demonstrating PII masking using [DocPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/docpivot) and [CloakPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/cloakpivot) together.

## Overview

This project provides a command-line tool that:
- Reads PDF documents using Docling
- Identifies personally identifiable information (PII)
- Masks sensitive data using CloakPivot
- Exports both masked and unmasked versions as markdown files

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Default Redaction)
```bash
python pii-cloak mask --infile data/pdf/email.pdf --output-format markdown --outdir data/md/
```

### With Replacement Strategy
```bash
python pii-cloak mask --infile data/pdf/email.pdf --output-format markdown --outdir data/md/ --strategy replace
```

### Available Strategies
- `redact` (default): Replaces PII with static placeholders like `[NAME]`, `[EMAIL]`, `[DATE]`
- `replace`: Replaces PII with masked characters (currently uses asterisks)

## Example Output

The script processes PDF documents and produces masked and unmasked versions. Here's the same email shown with different masking strategies:

### Unmasked Document

Hi Julian,

I'd definitely like to meet Inness if you think she'd be open to meeting! Thanks so so much for pounding the pavement so much for me here.

Best,

Cameron

PS - here are the remaining 3 birthdays you asked for :)

| surname   | first name   | birthdate   |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| White     | Johnson      | 1958-04-21  |

### Masked Document (Redact Strategy)

```markdown
# Masked Document (Strategy: redact)

Hi ******,

PS - here are the remaining *********** you asked for :)

| surname   | first name   | birthdate        |

## What Gets Masked

The tool automatically detects and masks:
- üìß Email addresses ‚Üí `[EMAIL]`
- üë§ Person names ‚Üí `[NAME]`
- üìÖ Dates and times ‚Üí `[DATE]`
- üì± Phone numbers ‚Üí `[PHONE]`
- üí≥ Credit card numbers ‚Üí `[CARD-****]`
- üè† Locations ‚Üí `[LOCATION]`
- And more...

## Output Files

The script generates three files per strategy:

### Default (Redact) Strategy:
- `{filename}.unmasked.md` - Original content in markdown format
- `{filename}.masked.md` - Content with PII replaced by placeholders
- `{filename}.cloakmap.json` - Detailed mapping of all masked entities

### Replace Strategy:
- `{filename}.unmasked.md` - Original content in markdown format (same as above)
- `{filename}.masked.replace.md` - Content with PII replaced by asterisks
- `{filename}.cloakmap.replace.json` - Detailed mapping with replacement metadata

## Dependencies

- [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) - PDF to structured document conversion
- [DocPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/docpivot) - Document processing pipeline
- [CloakPivot](https://github.com/hernamesbarbara/cloakpivot) - PII detection and masking
- [Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio) - PII detection engine (via CloakPivot)

## Known Limitations

- The `replace` strategy currently uses asterisks instead of realistic fake data due to a limitation in the CloakPivot/Presidio integration. Future versions may support realistic fake data generation using libraries like Faker.
